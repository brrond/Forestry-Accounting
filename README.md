# Forestry-Accounting

The project was developed as a graduation work of computer science degree and now has become playground for different AI projects.

Each individual idea or sub-project is described in separate `.md` file. This `README.md` contains only overview.

To start the program:
```
python -m forestryaccounting
```

## <a href="DEFORESTATION_REFORESTATION_DETECTION.md">Deforestation-reforestation detection with NDVI Based CNN</a>

The actual part of the original project. The idea is to use two NDVIs (from two different timestamps) to compare vegetation change and visualize change map.

## <a href="GUI_APPLICATION.md">Application</a>

Because it's awful idea to make a project that will work only from command line, GUI application was developed.
